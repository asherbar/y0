;; # Example Language

;; In this module we define the semantics of an example language: $y_1$. The
;; language will syntactically resemble Clojure, but will be statically-typed.

;; Most of the semantics of the language will revolve around its type system.
;; In the following we will define it, step by step.

;; ## Expression Types

;; We begin with defining `typeof`, a predicate to associate types to
;; expressions. In a way, the predicate `typeof` _defines_ the sub-language
;; of expressions because everything that can be given a type _is a valid
;; expression_.

;; We first define the base-case for this predicate. It uses the [built-in
;; predicate `inspect`](builtins.md#inspect) to understand the _kind_ of
;; expression, and calls `typeof-inspected` to pattern-match on the kind.
(all [x t]
     (typeof x t) <-
     (exist [k]
            (inspect x k)
            (typeof-inspected k x t)))

;; Now we define the base cases for `typeof-inspected`, starting with the base
;; case, rejecting kinds that are not supported by a specific rule.
(all [k x t]
     (typeof-inspected k x t ! x "is not a y1 expression"))

;; Now things that are not explicitly defined as $y_1$ expressions (so, all
;; things at this point) will result in this error message.
(assert
 (exist [t] (typeof foo t) ! foo "is not a y1 expression"))

;; Next, we add cases for the different literal types.
(all [x]
     (typeof-inspected :int x int))
(all [x]
     (typeof-inspected :float x float))
(all [x]
     (typeof-inspected :string x string))

(assert
 (typeof 42 int)
 (typeof 3.141593 float)
 (typeof "foo bar" string))

;; Vectors are assumed to have the same type for all elements. The type of
;; the first element is inferred and all elements need to match.
(all [v t]
     (typeof-inspected :vector v (vector t)) <-
     (all-typesof v t))

;; It uses a new predicate, `all-typesof` to unify the types of all elements in
;; the vector to a single type `t`.
(all [x t]
     (all-typesof x t ! "all-typesof does not support value" x))
(all [x xs t]
     (all-typesof [x & xs] t) <-
     (exist [t']
            (typeof x t)
            (all-typesof xs t')
            (= t t' ! "type mismatch between elements in a vector." x "is" t "while" xs "are" t')))
(all [t]
     (all-typesof [] t))


(assert
 (typeof [1] (vector int))
 (typeof [1 2 3] (vector int))
 (exist [t]
        (typeof [1 2 "three"] t)
        ! "type mismatch between elements in a vector." 2 "is" int
        "while" ["three"] "are" string))

;; ## Built-in Operators

;; $y_0$ defines a few operators that can be used in expressions.

;; Arithmetic (binary) operators are defined for numeric types (`int` and
;; `float`), and require that the operands are of the same type. The returnede
;; type is the same as the operands.
(all [a b t]
     (typeof (+ a b) t) <-
     (typeof a t)
     (exist [t']
            (typeof b t')
            (= t t' ! "Type mismatch in +." a "has type" t "while" b "has type" t')
            (numeric-type t)))

;; This definition provides a match for the `typeof` predicate directly. It
;; requires that both operands are of the same type. Then it requires that the
;; common type is numeric, using the `numeric-type` predicate that is defined
; as follows:

(all [x]
     (numeric-type x ! x "is not a numeric type"))
(all [] (numeric-type int))
(all [] (numeric-type float))

(assert
 (typeof (+ 1 (+ 2 3)) int)
 (typeof (+ 1.1 (+ 2.2 3.3)) float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (+ 1 (+ 2.2 3.3)) t)
        ! "Type mismatch in +." 1 "has type" int "while" (+ 2.2 3.3) "has type" float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (+ "1" (+ "2" "3")) t)
        ! string "is not a numeric type"))

;; Since we have at least three more operators to define, let's automate the
;; process using the following [translation rule](statements.md):
(all [op]
     (defbinumop op) =>
     (all [a b t]
          (typeof (op a b) t) <-
          (typeof a t)
          (exist [t']
                 (typeof b t')
                 (= t t' ! "Type mismatch in" op ":" a "has type" t "while" b "has type" t')
                 (numeric-type t))))

;; This repeats the rule for `(+ a b)`, but applies it to any operator that
;; will be defined using `defbinumop`.

;; Now we can define the rest of the operators and check that they are defined.
(defbinumop -)
(defbinumop *)
(defbinumop /)
(defbinumop mod)

(assert
 (typeof (- 1 (* 2 3)) int)
 (typeof (/ 1.1 (mod 2.2 3.3)) float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (* 1 (/ 2.2 3.3)) t)
        ! "Type mismatch in" * ":" 1 "has type" int "while" (/ 2.2 3.3) "has type" float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (mod "1" (- "2" "3")) t)
        ! string "is not a numeric type"))

;; ## `let` Expressions

;; Similar to Clojure, `let` expressions in $y_1$ have the following structure:
;; `(let [var-expr-pairs...] expr)` where `var-expr-pairs...` are zero or more
;; pairs of symbol and an expression and `expr` is an expression.

;; The type of such an expression is defined using the `typeof-let` predicate.
(all [var-expr-pairs expr t]
     (typeof (let var-expr-pairs expr) t) <-
     (typeof-let var-expr-pairs expr t))

;; The base rule for `typeof-let` handles the case where the `let` expression
;; does not get a vector as its first argument.
(all [x expr t]
     (typeof-let x expr t ! "let requires a vector as its first argument." x "is given"))

(assertx
 (exist [t] (typeof (let 2 3) t)
        ! "let requires a vector as its first argument." 2 "is given"))

;; Now we provide rules for a vector of at least two elements.
(all [var var-expr var-expr-pairs expr t]
     (typeof-let [var var-expr & var-expr-pairs] expr t) <-
     (inspect var :symbol
              ! "Variable names in let expressions must be symbols." var "is given")
     (exist [var-t]
            (typeof var-expr var-t)
            (given (all [] (typeof var var-t))
                   (typeof-let var-expr-pairs expr t))))


;; Given a variable name `var` and an expression to assign to it `var-expr`,
;; we start by checking that `var` is a symbol. Then we infer the type of `
;; var-expr` and then [inject](conditions.md##given-conditions) a rule defining
;; the type of `var` as the type inferred for `var-expr` before recursing for
;; the rest of the list.

;; The termination condition is the case for an empty vector, which simply
;; infers the type of `let`'s second argument.
(all [expr t]
     (typeof-let [] expr t) <-
     (typeof expr t))

;; Finally, we wish to provide an error for a case where the number of element
;; in the vector is odd.
(all [x expr t]
     (typeof-let [x] expr t
                 ! "The vector in a let expression must consist of var,expression pairs." 
                 x "is extra"))

;; Now we can check if our `let` expression behaves as expected.
(assert
 (typeof (let [] 42) int)
 (typeof (let [n 42] (+ n 2)) int)
 (typeof (let [n 42.0
               m (+ n 2.0)] (* n m)) float))

;; ## Monomorphic Functions

;; Monomorphic functions are functions for which both the parameter types and
;; the return type are fully defined with the function.

;; Monomorphic $y_1$ functions can be _declared_ or _defined_. The former just
;; provides the signature while the latter provides the signature along with
;; the implementation. Declared functions are assumed to have their definition
;; elsewhere, i.e., as built-in or foreign functions.

;; ### Declaring Monomorphic Functions

;; Declaring a monomorphic function is done by the `declfn` statement. It is
;; defined using the following translation rule.
(all [name params type]
     (declfn name params type) =>
     (assert 
      (exist []
             (inspect name :symbol 
                      ! "A function name must be a symbol." name "is given")
             (inspect params :vector
                      ! "Parameter types need to be provided as a vector." 
                      params "is given")))
     (all [args]
          (typeof (name & args) type) <-
          (exist [arg-types]
                 (typesof args arg-types)
                 (check-types params arg-types args name))))

;; This translation rule translates a `declfn` definition, which takes a name,
;; a vector of params and a return type to two things:
;; 1. An `assert` block, which performs two assertions: one to make sure the
;; name is a symbol and the other, to make sure that the parameters are given
;; as a vector.

;; These assertions run whenever a `declfn` statement is loaded. We can test
;; them using "empty" `given` conditions.
(assert
 (given (declfn foo [int float] string))
 (given (declfn :foo [int float] string)
        ! "A function name must be a symbol." :foo "is given")
 (given (declfn foo (int float) string)
        ! "Parameter types need to be provided as a vector."
        (int float) "is given"))

;; The second statement generated by the rule defines a rule for `typeof`,
;; which matches against any list that starts with `name`. The rule calls two
;; predicates that we have yet to define, so this is a good place to do so.

;; `typesof` takes a list of expressions and provides a list of their types.
(all [xs ts]
     (typesof xs ts ! "typesof requires a list as its first argument." xs "is given"))
(all [x xs t ts]
     (typesof (x & xs) (t & ts)) <-
     (typeof x t)
     (typesof xs ts))
(all []
     (typesof () ()))

(assert
 (typesof (1 "two" 3.0) (int string float)))

;; `check-types` takes a vector of expected types (`params`) and a list of
;; inferred types (`arg-tyeps`) and succeeds if all they match. iThe `args`
;; and `name` of the function are given for reference.
(all [params arg-types args name]
     (check-types params arg-types args name
                  ! "check-types requires params to be provided as a vector."
                  params "is given"))

(all [param params arg-types args name]
     (check-types [param & params] arg-types args name) <-
     (exist [type types a as]
            (= arg-types (type & types)
               ! "Too few arguments in call to function" name)
            (= args (a & as)
               ! "Too few arguments in call to function" name)
            (= param type ! "Type mismatch in parameter for function" name
               ": argument" a "is of type" type "but" param "is required")
            (check-types params types as name)))

(all [arg-types args name]
     (check-types [] arg-types args name) <-
     (= args () ! "Too many arguments in call to function" name
        ": extra arguments:" args))

;; We focus our discussion on the second rule. Its head pattern-matches on the
;; first argument only, in order to provide meaningful explanations when the
;; other arguments in the goal do not match. After destructing each of them,
;; the correctness of the specific type is checked using the `=` predicate.
(assert
 (check-types [int float string] (int float string) (a b c) foo)
 (check-types [int float string] (int int string) (a b c) foo
              ! "Type mismatch in parameter for function" foo
              ": argument" b "is of type" int "but" float "is required")
 (check-types [int float string] (int float) (a b) foo
              ! "Too few arguments in call to function" foo)
 (check-types [int float string] (int float string (vector int)) (a b c d) foo
              ! "Too many arguments in call to function" foo
                ": extra arguments:" (d)))

;; So now we are ready to declare a few functions and use them in expressions.
;; We will start with conversion functions between primitive types.
(declfn float [int] float)
(declfn round [float] int)
(declfn ceil [float] int)
(declfn floor [float] int)
(declfn trunc [float] int)
(declfn parse-int [string] int)
(declfn parse-float [string] float)
(declfn as-decimal [int] string)
(declfn as-hex [int] string)
(declfn as-scientific [float] string)


;; Now let us use some of these functions in expressions.
(assert
 (typeof (round (+ (parse-float "3.0") (float 2))) int)
 (typeof (round (+ (parse-int "3.0") (float "2"))) int
         ! "Type mismatch in parameter for function" float
         ": argument" "2" "is of type" string "but" int "is required"))
