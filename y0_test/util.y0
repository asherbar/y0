;; # Utility Predicates

;; This module defines generic utility predicates, useful for defining
;; languages.

;; ## Verifying Elements

;; Here we define two predicates that verify that the elements of a collection
;; (vector or list) all meet a certain criterion. In order to be able to do
;; this we need to first define an abstraction for defining predicates on the
;; elements. To do so, we define `is`, a predicate that takes a `description`
;; and a term and accepts the term if it matches the description.

;; By default, `is` will reject the description.
(all [desc term]
     (is desc term ! desc "is not a valid term description"))

;; A description of `symbol` requires that the term is a symbol.
(all [term]
     (is symbol term) <-
     (inspect term :symbol ! "Expected a symbol, received" term))

(assert
 (is symbol foo)
 (is symbol 42 ! "Expected a symbol, received" 42)
 (is not-a-description foo
     ! not-a-description "is not a valid term description"))

;; `vector-of` is a predicate that takes a term expected to be a vector and a
;; description for its elements. It accepts vectors where all elements match
;; the description.
(all [vec desc]
     (vector-of vec desc ! vec "is not a vector"))
(all [x xs desc]
     (vector-of [x & xs] desc) <-
     (is desc x)
     (vector-of xs desc))
(all [desc]
     (vector-of [] desc))

(assert
 (vector-of [a b c] symbol)
 (vector-of [a 3 c] symbol ! "Expected a symbol, received" 3)
 (vector-of (a b c) symbol ! (a b c) "is not a vector"))

;; Similarly, `list-of` accepts a list of element that match the given
;; description.
(all [list desc]
     (list-of list desc ! list "is not a list"))
(all [x xs desc]
     (list-of (x & xs) desc) <-
     (is desc x)
     (list-of xs desc))
(all [desc]
     (list-of () desc))

(assert
 (list-of (a b c) symbol)
 (list-of (a 3 c) symbol ! "Expected a symbol, received" 3)
 (list-of [a b c] symbol ! [a b c] "is not a list"))
