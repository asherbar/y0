;; # Example Language

;; In this module we define the semantics of an example language: $y_1$. The
;; language will syntactically resemble Clojure, but will be statically-typed.

;; Most of the semantics of the language will revolve around its type system.
;; In the following we will define it, step by step.

;; ## Expression Types

;; We begin with defining `typeof`, a predicate to associate types to
;; expressions. In a way, the predicate `typeof` _defines_ the sub-language
;; of expressions because everything that can be given a type _is a valid
;; expression_.

;; We first define the base-case for this predicate. It uses the [built-in
;; predicate `inspect`](builtins.md#inspect) to understand the _kind_ of
;; expression, and calls `typeof-inspected` to pattern-match on the kind.
(all [x t]
     (typeof x t) <-
     (exist [k]
            (inspect x k)
            (typeof-inspected k x t)))

;; Now we define the base cases for `typeof-inspected`, starting with the base
;; case, rejecting kinds that are not supported by a specific rule.
(all [k x t]
     (typeof-inspected k x t ! x "is not a y1 expression"))

;; Now things that are not explicitly defined as $y_1$ expressions (so, all
;; things at this point) will result in this error message.
(assert
 (exist [t] (typeof foo t) ! foo "is not a y1 expression"))

;; Next, we add cases for the different literal types.
(all [x]
     (typeof-inspected :int x int))
(all [x]
     (typeof-inspected :float x float))
(all [x]
     (typeof-inspected :string x string))

(assert
 (typeof 42 int)
 (typeof 3.141593 float)
 (typeof "foo bar" string))

;; Vectors are assumed to have the same type for all elements. The type of
;; the first element is inferred and all elements need to match.
(all [v t]
     (typeof-inspected :vector v (vector t)) <-
     (all-typesof v t))

;; It uses a new predicate, `all-typesof` to unify the types of all elements in
;; the vector to a single type `t`.
(all [x t]
     (all-typesof x t ! "all-typesof does not support value" x))
(all [x xs t]
     (all-typesof [x & xs] t) <-
     (exist [t']
            (typeof x t)
            (all-typesof xs t')
            (= t t' ! "type mismatch between elements in a vector." x "is" t "while" xs "are" t')))
(all [t]
     (all-typesof [] t))


(assert
 (typeof [1] (vector int))
 (typeof [1 2 3] (vector int))
 (exist [t]
        (typeof [1 2 "three"] t)
        ! "type mismatch between elements in a vector." 2 "is" int
        "while" ["three"] "are" string))

;; ## Built-in Operators

;; $y_0$ defines a few operators that can be used in expressions.

;; Arithmetic (binary) operators are defined for numeric types (`int` and
;; `float`), and require that the operands are of the same type. The returnede
;; type is the same as the operands.
(all [a b t]
     (typeof (+ a b) t) <-
     (typeof a t)
     (exist [t']
            (typeof b t')
            (= t t' ! "Type mismatch in +." a "has type" t "while" b "has type" t')
            (numeric-type t)))

;; This definition provides a match for the `typeof` predicate directly. It
;; requires that both operands are of the same type. Then it requires that the
;; common type is numeric, using the `numeric-type` predicate that is defined
; as follows:

(all [x]
     (numeric-type x ! x "is not a numeric type"))
(all [] (numeric-type int))
(all [] (numeric-type float))

(assert
 (typeof (+ 1 (+ 2 3)) int)
 (typeof (+ 1.1 (+ 2.2 3.3)) float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (+ 1 (+ 2.2 3.3)) t)
        ! "Type mismatch in +." 1 "has type" int "while" (+ 2.2 3.3) "has type" float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (+ "1" (+ "2" "3")) t)
        ! string "is not a numeric type"))

;; Since we have at least three more operators to define, let's automate the
;; process using the following [translation rule](statements.md):
(all [op]
     (defbinumop op) =>
     (all [a b t]
          (typeof (op a b) t) <-
          (typeof a t)
          (exist [t']
                 (typeof b t')
                 (= t t' ! "Type mismatch in" op ":" a "has type" t "while" b "has type" t')
                 (numeric-type t))))

;; This repeats the rule for `(+ a b)`, but applies it to any operator that
;; will be defined using `defbinumop`.

;; Now we can define the rest of the operators and check that they are defined.
(defbinumop -)
(defbinumop *)
(defbinumop /)
(defbinumop mod)

(assert
 (typeof (- 1 (* 2 3)) int)
 (typeof (/ 1.1 (mod 2.2 3.3)) float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (* 1 (/ 2.2 3.3)) t)
        ! "Type mismatch in" * ":" 1 "has type" int "while" (/ 2.2 3.3) "has type" float)
 (exist [t]
        (typeof (mod "1" (- "2" "3")) t)
        ! string "is not a numeric type"))

;; ## `let` Expressions

;; Similar to Clojure, `let` expressions in $y_1$ have the following structure:
;; `(let [var-expr-pairs...] expr)` where `var-expr-pairs...` are zero or more
;; pairs of symbol and an expression and `expr` is an expression.

;; The type of such an expression is defined using the `typeof-let` predicate.
(all [var-expr-pairs expr t]
     (typeof (let var-expr-pairs expr) t) <-
     (typeof-let var-expr-pairs expr t))

;; The base rule for `typeof-let` handles the case where the `let` expression
;; does not get a vector as its first argument.
(all [x expr t]
     (typeof-let x expr t ! "let requires a vector as its first argument." x "is given"))

(assertx
 (exist [t] (typeof (let 2 3) t)
        ! "let requires a vector as its first argument." 2 "is given"))

;; Now we provide rules for a vector of at least two elements.
(all [var var-expr var-expr-pairs expr t]
     (typeof-let [var var-expr & var-expr-pairs] expr t) <-
     (inspect var :symbol
              ! "Variable names in let expressions must be symbols." var "is given")
     (exist [var-t]
            (typeof var-expr var-t)
            (given (all [] (typeof var var-t))
                   (typeof-let var-expr-pairs expr t))))


;; Given a variable name `var` and an expression to assign to it `var-expr`,
;; we start by checking that `var` is a symbol. Then we infer the type of `
;; var-expr` and then [inject](conditions.md##given-conditions) a rule defining
;; the type of `var` as the type inferred for `var-expr` before recursing for
;; the rest of the list.

;; The termination condition is the case for an empty vector, which simply
;; infers the type of `let`'s second argument.
(all [expr t]
     (typeof-let [] expr t) <-
     (typeof expr t))

;; Finally, we wish to provide an error for a case where the number of element
;; in the vector is odd.
(all [x expr t]
     (typeof-let [x] expr t
                 ! "The vector in a let expression must consist of var,expression pairs." 
                 x "is extra"))

;; Now we can check if our `let` expression behaves as expected.
(assert
 (typeof (let [] 42) int)
 (typeof (let [n 42] (+ n 2)) int)
 (typeof (let [n 42.0
               m (+ n 2.0)] (* n m)) float))

;; ## Monomorphic Functions

;; Monomorphic functions are functions for which both the parameter types and
;; the return type are fully defined with the function.

;; Monomorphic $y_1$ functions can be _declared_ or _defined_. The former just
;; provides the signature while the latter provides the signature along with
;; the implementation. Declared functions are assumed to have their definition
;; elsewhere, i.e., as built-in or foreign functions.

;; ### Declaring Monomorphic Functions

;; Declaring a monomorphic function is done by the `declfn` statement. It is
;; defined using the following translation rule.
(all [name params type]
     (declfn name params type) =>
     (assert 
      (exist []
             (inspect name :symbol 
                      ! "A function name must be a symbol." name "is given")
             (inspect params :vector
                      ! "Parameter types need to be provided as a vector." 
                      params "is given")))
     (all [args]
          (typeof (name & args) type) <-
          (exist [arg-types]
                 (check-decl-types params args name))))

;; This translation rule translates a `declfn` definition, which takes a name,
;; a vector of params and a return type to two things:
;; 1. An `assert` block, which performs two assertions: one to make sure the
;; name is a symbol and the other, to make sure that the parameters are given
;; as a vector.

;; These assertions run whenever a `declfn` statement is loaded. We can test
;; them using "empty" `given` conditions.
(assert
 (given (declfn foo [int float] string))
 (given (declfn :foo [int float] string)
        ! "A function name must be a symbol." :foo "is given")
 (given (declfn foo (int float) string)
        ! "Parameter types need to be provided as a vector."
        (int float) "is given"))

;; The second statement generated by the rule defines calls to the declared
;; function as $y_1$ expressions. The rule uses `check-decl-types` to check
;; that the types of the arguments match the declared parameter types.
(all [params args name]
     (check-decl-types params args name
                       ! "Parameter list must be a vector in call to check-decl-types."
                       params "is given"))
(all [param params args name]
     (check-decl-types [param & params] args name) <-
     (exist [arg args']
            (= args (arg & args')
               ! "Too few arguments in call to function" name "."
               "expecting" [param & params])
            (exist [arg-type]
                   (typeof arg arg-type)
                   (= param arg-type
                      ! "Type mismatch in call to function" name
                      arg "has type" arg-type "while" param "is expected"))
            (check-decl-types params args' name)))

(all [args name]
     (check-decl-types [] args name) <-
     (= args () ! "Too many arguments in call to" name "." args "are extra"))

;; The second rule is worth an explanation. It matches non-empty `params`
;; vectors. First, it pattern-matches the `args`, to see that there exists an
;; argument for the first (and therefore, each) parameter. Then we infer its
;; type using `typeof` and compare (`=`) it to the declared type. Finally,
;; we recurse to check the rest of the arguments.

(assert
 (check-decl-types [int float string] (1 2.3 "four") foo)
 (check-decl-types [int float string] (1 2 "four") foo
                   ! "Type mismatch in call to function" foo
                   2 "has type" int "while" float "is expected")
 (check-decl-types [int float string] (1 2.3) foo
                   ! "Too few arguments in call to function" foo "."
                   "expecting" [string])
 (check-decl-types [int float string] (1 2.3 "four" five) foo
                   ! "Too many arguments in call to" foo "." (five) "are extra"))

;; So now we are ready to declare a few functions and use them in expressions.
;; We will start with conversion functions between primitive types.
(declfn float [int] float)
(declfn round [float] int)
(declfn ceil [float] int)
(declfn floor [float] int)
(declfn trunc [float] int)
(declfn parse-int [string] int)
(declfn parse-float [string] float)
(declfn as-decimal [int] string)
(declfn as-hex [int] string)
(declfn as-scientific [float] string)


;; Now let us use some of these functions in expressions.
(assert
 (typeof (round (+ (parse-float "3.0") (float 2))) int)
 (typeof (round (+ (parse-int "3.0") (float "2"))) int
         ! "Type mismatch in call to function" float
           "2" "has type" string "while" int "is expected"))

;; ### Defining Monomorphic Functions

;; $y_1$ monomorphic functions are defined using the `defn` statement. Its
;; overall structure resembles the definition of the same name in Clojure, but
;; the parameters vector consists of name, type pairs.

;; As our running example, let us consider the following function:
(defn square [x float]
  (* x x))

;; This function has a single parameter, `x` of type `float`. It multiplies it
;; by itself to give the square. The return type is not provided explicitly in
;; the definition. It is instead inferred to be `float`.

;; In the following, we work toward giving this definition meaning. We start by
;; defining the meaning of the `declvars-` statement. This is a statement that
;; will allow us to inject the parameters into the scope of the function's
;; body. Following Clojure's convention, the `-` at the end of the name
;; indicates that it is _private_, i.e., only used within this module.
(all [var type vartypes]
     (declvars- [var type & vartypes]) =>
     (all [] (typeof var type))
     (declvars- vartypes))

;; `declvars-` takes a vector of name, type pairs and associates the types to
;; with the names. For example:
(assert
 (given (declvars- [a int
                    b float
                    c string])
        (typeof a int)
        (typeof b float)
        (typeof c string)))

;; Now we are ready to define the translation rule for `defn`.
(all [name params body]
     (defn name params body) =>
     (assert
      (exist []
             (inspect name :symbol
                      ! "The name of a function must be a symbol." name "is given")
             (inspect params :vector
                      ! "A function's parameter list must be a vector" params "is given")
             (given (declvars- params)
                    (exist [type]
                           (typeof body type)))))
     (all [args type]
          (typeof (name & args) type) <-
          (check-defn-types params args name)
          (given (declvars- params)
                 (typeof body type))))

;; A `defn` statement is translated into two statements. The first is an
;; `assert` block that checks three properties of the definition:
;; 1. That the name is a symbol,
;; 2. That the parameters are given in a vector, and
;; 3. That with the parameters defined, the body is a valid expression.
(assert
 (given (defn foo [a int
                   b float]
          (+ a (round b))))
 (given (defn "foo" [a int
                     b float]
          (+ a (round b)))
        ! "The name of a function must be a symbol." "foo" "is given")
 (given (defn foo (a int
                   b float)
          (+ a (round b)))
        ! "A function's parameter list must be a vector" (a int b float) "is given")
 (given (defn foo [a int
                   b float]
          (+ a b))
        ! "Type mismatch in +." a "has type" int "while" b "has type" float))

;; The second statement is a rule that accepts calls to the defined function as
;; $y_1$ expressions. It first checks that the argument types match the
;; parameter definition, then it repeats the same `given` condition as in the
;; assertion, but this time type `type` is bound to the expression's type.

;; The argument check is done using `check-defn-types`, which we define next.
(all [params args name]
     (check-defn-types params args name
                       ! "check-defn-types requires a params vector as its first argument."
                       params "is given"))
(all [var var-type params args name]
     (check-defn-types [var var-type & params] args name) <-
     (exist [arg args']
            (= args (arg & args')
               ! "Too few arguments in call to function" name "."

     (check-defn-types [] args name) <-
     (= args ()
        ! "Too many argument given to function" name "."
        args "are extra"))

;; We demonstrate it by inferring the type of an expression containing
;; `square`, as we defined it above.
(assert
 (typeof (square 2.0) float)
 (exist [type]
        (typeof (square 2) type)

        (typeof (square 2.0 "please round up") type)
        ! "Too many argument given to function" square "."
          ("please round up") "are extra"))

;; ## Type Classes

;; In contrast to monomorphic functions, whose type signatures are constant,
;; _polimorphic functions_ are functions whose signature may change. Two types
;; of polimorphism supported by $y_1$: _parametric polimorphism_, in which some
;; types in the signature are completely open and can take any value, and
;; _ad-hoc polimorphism_, where some types in the signature can take certain
;; values, as long as some properties are guarantees for them.

;; Ad-hoc polimorphism is implemented using _type classes_, which we cover
;; here.

;; ### Type Class Definition

;; A type-class is defined using the `defclass` statement, defined as follows.
(all [name types methods]
     (defclass name types
       & methods) =>
     (assert
      (exist []
             (inspect name :symbol
                      ! "A class name needs to be a symbol." name "is given")
             (class-type-symbols types name)
             (class-methods methods)))
     (all [type' types']

                ! type' "is not a type in class" name))
     (all []
          (methods-for-class name types methods)))

;; This definition translates a `defclass` statement into three things:
;; 1. An assertion that checks that the `name` is a symbol, `types` is a vector
;;    of symbols and that the `methods` are valid method definitions (we will
;;    define `class-type-symbols` and `class-methods` later).
;; 2. A base rule for a predicate named after the class. This predicate takes
;;    two arguments, the `type` that is supposed to be a member of the class
;;    and `types`, auxiliary types that are derived from this type.
;; 3. A rule for `methods-for-class`, providing the methods defined for this
;;    class. The base rule for this predicate is provided below.
(all [class types methods]
     (methods-for-class class types methods
                        ! class "is not defined as a type-class"))

;; `class-type-symbols` is defined as follows.

              ! "The parameter list of a method must be a vector." params "is given"))

;; After the base definition that rejects everything, we define a rule to
;; accept declarations similar to
;; [those of monomorphic functions](#declaring-monomorphic-functions).
;; Polymorphic functions are supported too, but we defer their definition until
;; later.

;; Now we can define our first type class. `Showable` is a class with one
;; method: `show`, which takes a single argument of a member type and returns
;; a string representing it.
(defclass Show [t]
  (declfn show [t] string))

;; This defines a case for `methods-for-class` and a base rule for predicate
;; `Show`.
